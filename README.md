## Overview

MahaUtils provides a collection of Python tools to support research work at the [Maha Fluid Power Research Center](https://engineering.purdue.edu/Maha/) at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/).  The classes, functions, and other objects in this package are intended to assist with general-purpose research tasks as well as simplify interaction with the [Maha Multics](https://avaccadev.github.io/Multics/) software.

> **Warning**
> The MahaUtils source code and documentation refers to the "Maha Multics" software in a number of places.  **The "Maha Multics" software is NOT related to the [Multics operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multics).**  It is an unrelated fluid simulation software designed for analyzing hydraulic pumps and motors.


## Installation

The recommended way to install MahaUtils is through [pip](https://pypi.org/project/mahautils/):

```
pip install mahautils
```

For more information about configuring Python and using packages, refer to the official Python documentation on [setting up Python](https://docs.python.org/3/using/index.html) and [installing packages](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/).
