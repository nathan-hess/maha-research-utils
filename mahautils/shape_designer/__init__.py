"""**Tools for creating patterns of geometric shapes**

The :py:mod:`mahautils.shape_designer` module is intended to facilitate
building complex patterns of geometric shapes.  This can be useful when
preparing input files for simulations, such as files that specify port shapes
and locations for pumps and motors.
