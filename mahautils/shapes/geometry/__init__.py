"""**Shapes that can be used when constructing geometry with MahaUtils**

This module provides geometric shapes that can be used when creating more
complex geometry (for instance, to write Maha Multics polygon files).  The
specification of the shapes in this module is intended to be as generic and
flexible as possible to allow greater freedom in building complex geometry.
