About the Project
=================

The |PackageNameStylized| project began in 2022.  |author| had developed a
number of Python scripts and functions for various research tasks at the
`Maha Fluid Power Research Center <https://engineering.purdue.edu/Maha/>`__
and was interested in sharing the code with other researchers.

In order to follow best CI/CD practices, it was decided that the best
approach would be to create a Python package and distribute it through PyPI.
This would allow other researchers at the lab -- and even external individuals
or groups -- to access updated versions of the code and contribute
improvements if desired.  Furthermore, it allowed a robust set of automated
tests and and reviews to be set up.

Since the beginning of the project, the code base has grown from a small
collection of file parsers to a number of different general research utilities.
The tools are intended to be useful for anyone doing research work at Maha Lab
or using software developed by Maha, and we hope that it may also serve as an
inspiration to provide ideas for other software development projects.
